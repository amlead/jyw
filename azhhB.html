     <h1> MY COURSE IN COLLEGE </h1>
     <p><b> After graduating from senior high school, we shall choose a course as we step forward to college. Engineering was my first choice, but as I grew up I realized that it was not for me because I prefer Mathematics more than Science, and that's when I thought of taking an accountancy course. </b></p>
     <h2> WHAT IS AN ACCOUNTANT? </h2>
     <p><b> An Accountant is responsible for the management and reporting of financial data of an organization. Moreover, they ensure that the books are balanced and the tax obligations are covered. Additionally, they prepare balance sheets, profit, and other financial reports, and help businesses make crucial financial decisions by collecting, tracking, and correcting the company's finances. An accountant partners with the upper management and aids them in making critical decisions. </b></p>
     <h3> WHY DO I CHOOSE ACCOUNTING? </h3>
     <p><b> Here are 10 reasons why I want to pursue accountancy. First, I think I'll be more capable of operating basic mathematics than geometry. Second, after I graduate and get a license, getting a job and getting hired will be easier. Third, it has multiple career options as accountancy has many areas and is a diverse field of work. Fourth, I'll have the opportunity to work in different industries, as every industry needs an accountant, whether in technology industries or financial services. Fifth, accountancy has different specializations so I can specialize in specific accounting areas such as bookkeeping, financial accounting, managerial accounting, and tax accounting. Sixth, it offers higher earning potential and the income is competitive. Seventh, it is a stable and growing job field because it is secured as accountants are in-demand jobs. Moreover, there is entrepreneurial potential because I can open an accounting firm to grow in my career if I want. Additionally, I'll improve my analytical skills and my decision-making capabilities.
Lastly, I'll better understand finances, how to budget, spend wisely, and manage my money effectively. </b></p>
